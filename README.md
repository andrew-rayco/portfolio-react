# Express React Webpack Boilerplate
At last, a boilerplate that I understand inside and out, because I built it.

## How to use
1. Create a new empty directory for your project, cd into it and `git clone` this repository (use `git clone [git URL] .` to clone into current directory)
2. `npm install` to install the modules & dependencies
3. `rm -rf .git && git init` to remove git tracking on this repo and start a new git
4. Create a new repo on Github (or your repository service of choice) and copy the url (e.g. https://github.com/user/repo.git)
5. `git remote add origin [new repo URL]` to link this project with the new remote repo
6. `git remote -v` to verify new remote url has been added
7. Commit and push and then get building!

## Routing
Routing is client side with react-router.
There are some example server routes commented out in server.js.
